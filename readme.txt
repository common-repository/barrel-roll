Makes your page do a barrel roll like Google.

== Description ==

Makes your page do a barrel roll. Google can do it. Now you can too. 

When a user types <em>barrel roll</em> into any text filed on the page (for example, in the phrase 'do a barrel roll'), the page will rotate 360 degrees and come to rest as it was. Try it.

= Why? =

Only if you tell it to.
